How To Add a Specification to SmarterApp.org
============================================

A. Do the following in a local copy of the smarterapp.github.io repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1. Copy the original document in it's editable format (typically MS Office) into the "_original_documents" folder of the repository.

   2. Rename the document stripping any leading date and substituting underscores for spaces.

   3. Export a copy of the document into .pdf format keeping the balance of the filename the same.

   4. Put the .pdf version in the "documents" folder.

   5. In the _posts folder of the repository create a description of the new document that will appear on the "Specifications" page. Use one of the other spec descriptions as a template. Each description is one text file using [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Make sure that the YAML header (the part at be beginning between the three-dash lines) includes layout, category, title, date, the URL of the document you just posted and the status. The balance of the description is a description of the document you just posted.

   6. If the new specification is significant enough to merit mention in the SmarterApp.org news feed, create a news feed post in the _posts folder using one of the other news items as a template.

B. Commit the updates
---------------------

   1. Commit the changes to your local repository.

   2. Push the changes to GitHub.
