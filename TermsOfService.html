<h2 id="Scope">1. Scope</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service apply to SmarterApp.org web site as well as all 
associated services including, but not limited to, the source code repository 
on GitHub and mail lists on Google Groups (collectively, the “Site”).
</p>
<h2 id="Eligibility">2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>The SmarterApp.org.org Site is not available to persons under the age 
of 18 or to any users previously suspended or removed from the Site by Smarter 
Balanced or its delegate. By registering for any services you represent

<h2 id="Privacy">3. Privacy Policy.</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to Smarter Balanced. The SmarterApp.org privacy 
policy is incorporated here. Please read this notice carefully for information 
relating to Smarter Balanced’s collection, use, and disclosure of your personal 
information. </p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">SmarterApp.org Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>(a) Log Files.</h3>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically 
and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) 
addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit 
pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. These data 
may include personal identifiable information. </p>
<h3>(b) Cookies.</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for 
record-keeping purposes. We may use session ID cookies or persistent cookies. 
We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A 
session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie 
remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove 
persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's 
'help' file. For example, a persistent cookie may be used to facilitate 
subsequent logins or to customize your experience according to previous 
visits. If you configure your browser to reject persistent cookies you may 
continue to use the site with only limited impairment. If you reject all 
cookies your ability to access content or services that require a login 
will be impaired. </p>
<h3>(c) Profile.</h3>
<p>We may store information that we collect through registration and the 
contributions you make to the community to create a 'profile' of your preferences 
and activities, to serve the community and to enforce IP and use policies. 
All contributions you make on the site or associated services are linked 
to your user profile and login/screen name. If you have shared your profile, 
any member of the site can view your profile and the information stored 
there (except your password) and all of your published contributions (but 
not your unpublished contributions). While we may make available certain 
privacy settings for your profile, we cannot guarantee that any information 
that you provide to us in your profile will not be accessible by third parties, 
such as by unauthorized third party access or other access. </p>
<h3>(d) Uses of Information.</h3>
<p>Smarter Balanced collects personal information that you disclose when 
you register with the site, when you grant access to an Authentication Service, 
and through your use of the services on the site. Smarter Balanced automatically 
receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including 
your IP address, Smarter Balanced cookies, the contributions you make and 
the page you request. Smarter Balanced uses information for the following 
general purposes, to: monitor traffic, improve our services, enforce terms 
of use and IP policies, contact you, and conduct research. </p>
<h3>(e) Our Commitment to Children's Privacy.</h3>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For 
that reason, Smarter Balanced does not knowingly collect or maintain personally 
identifiable information on the SmarterApp.org Site from persons under 13 
years-of-age. If Smarter Balanced learns that personally-identifiable information 
of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on the SmarterApp.org 
Site without verifiable parental consent, then Smarter Balanced will take 
the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or 
guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a 
Smarter Balanced Site account, then you may alert Smarter Balanced at
<a href="mailto:webmaster@smarterbalanced.org">Webmaster@SmarterBalanced.org</a>; 
and request that Smarter Balanced delete that child’s personal information 
from its systems. </p>
<h3>(f) Newsletters and Notifications.</h3>
<p>You may opt-into email-based notifications. These notifications include 
community news, notifications of content changes and updates, discussion 
groups and other notifications. You may opt out of notifications at any 
time. In some cases, these notifications are supplied by third-party providers 
such as Google Groups and GitHub. Accordingly, you may have to opt-out with 
each third-party provider to eliminate all SmarterApp.org related communication.
</p>
<h3>(g) Service-Related Announcements.</h3>
<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions 
when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily 
suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may 
not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. 
If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your 
account. </p>
<h3>(h) Personally Identifiable Information.</h3>
<p>Smarter Balanced is not in the business of selling your personal information. 
We do not share personally identifiable information with third parties as 
long as you keep your user profile private and we do not rent, sell, or 
share personal information about you collected in connection with your use 
of the SmarterApp.org Site with other people or entities, except as otherwise 
specified. However, other users of the Site will have access to contributions 
you make including, but not limited to, comments, feature requests, bug 
reports, comments, specifications and source code. You should therefore 
treat this as a public site and assume that your supervisor and future employers 
will have access to any information you provide on this website. We may 
share your personally identifiable information with companies that provide 
services to us in connection with developing, operating and maintaining 
the Site and our operations, including outside vendors, contractors, and 
agents who help us manage our operations. We only authorize such entities 
to use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy 
and for no other purpose than to provide us necessary services. Under no 
circumstances will your password ever be stored or shared in unencrypted 
form. </p>
<h3>(i) Associated Services.</h3>
<p>The services of associated websites such as GitHub and GoogleGroups are 
governed by the privacy policies of those sites. This policy does not supersede 
those policies and only governs the sharing of information between SmarterApp.org 
and those services. Users are admonished to read the privacy policies of 
associated sites before enrolling in their services. </p>
<h3>(j) Links to Other Sites.</h3>
<p>This Web site may contain links to other sites that are not owned, controlled 
by or associated with SmarterApp.org or Smarter Balanced. Please be aware 
that we, Smarter Balanced, are not responsible for the privacy practices 
of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site 
and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects 
personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only 
to information collected by this web site. </p>
<h3>(k) Security.</h3>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal 
information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive 
it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic 
storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially 
acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee 
its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web 
site, you can email us at Webmaster@SmarterBalanced.org. </p>
<h3>(l) Business Transitions.</h3>
<p>In the event SmarterApp.org or Smarter Balanced goes through a business 
transition, such as a merger, or acquisition by another entity, your personally 
identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You 
will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any 
such change in ownership or control of your personal information. </p>
<h3>(m) Legal Disclaimer.</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information 
as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect 
our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or 
legal process served on Smarter Balanced. We reserve the right to amend 
or modify our privacy policy at any time. If we change our privacy policy, 
we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, or other 
places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we 
collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose 
it. </p>

of liability set forth herein reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of 
risk between you and Smarter Balanced, and that the warranty disclaimers 
and the limitations of liability set forth herein form an essential basis 
of the bargain between you and Smarter Balanced. Smarter Balanced would 
not be able to provide the SmarterApp.org Site to you on an economically 
reasonable basis without these limitations. </p>
<p><b>13.5 Limitations by Applicable Law.</b> Some states or other jurisdictions 
do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusions 
may not apply to you. You may also have other rights that vary from state 
to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. </p>
<h2 id="Misc">14. Miscellaneous.</h2>
<p><b>14.1 Notice.</b> Smarter Balanced may provide You with notices, including 
those regarding changes to these Terms of Service, by email, regular mail 
or postings on the SmarterApp.org Site. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four 
hours after email is sent, unless Smarter Balanced is notified that the 
email address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give You legal notice by 
mail to a postal address, if provided by You through the SmarterApp.org 
Site. In such case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date 
of mailing. Notice posted on the SmarterApp.org Site is deemed given 30 
days following the initial posting. </p>
<p><b>14.2 Waiver.</b> The failure of Smarter Balanced to exercise or enforce 
any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such 
right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective 
only if in writing and signed by Smarter Balanced. </p>
<p><b>14.3 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.</b> (a) Governing Law. These 
Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the 
State of Washington, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts 
of law. (b) Arbitration. For any claim related to these Terms of Service 
or the Smarter Balanced Site, excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable 
relief, where the total amount sought is less than ten thousand U.S. Dollars 
($10,000.00 USD), either Smarter Balanced or You may elect at any point 
in or during a dispute or proceeding to resolve the claim through binding 
non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate 
it through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider 
mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must 
comply with the following rules: (1) the arbitration shall be conducted, 
at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based 
solely on written submissions; (2) the arbitration shall not involve any 
personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually 
agreed by the parties; and (3) any judgment on the award rendered by the 
arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. (c) Jurisdiction. 
You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating 
to these Terms or Smarter Balanced will be filed only in the state or federal 
courts in and for Thurston County personal and exclusive jurisdiction of 
such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action, except as provided 
in Section 14.3(b) regarding arbitration. Notwithstanding this, either party 
shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief 
to protect or enforce that party’s intellectual property rights in any court 
of competent jurisdiction where the other party resides or has its principal 
place of business. (d) Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against 
Smarter Balanced must be resolved in accordance with this Section 14.3. 
All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section 14.3 shall be considered 
improperly filed. Should either party file a claim contrary to this Section 
14.3, the other party may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to one thousand 
U.S. Dollars ($1,000.00 USD), provided that such party seeking such fees 
has notified the other in writing of the improperly filed claim, and the 
other has failed to promptly withdraw the claim. </p>
<p><b>14.4 Severability.</b> If any provision of these Terms or any Guidelines 
is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that 
provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms to the minimum 
extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of 
any remaining provisions. </p>
<p><b>14.5 Assignment.</b> These Terms and related Guidelines, and any rights 
and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by You, 
but may be assigned by Smarter Balanced without restriction. Any assignment
