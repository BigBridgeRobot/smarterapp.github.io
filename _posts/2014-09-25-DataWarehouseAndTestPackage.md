On Friday, September 25 we posted [nine new documents](http://www.smarterapp.org/specifications) associated with the Data Warehouse and Reporting system. These include data format specifications, a deployment guide, system architecture, and data model.

Also posted is the [Practice Test Package](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/PracticeTestPackage.html) which includes test definitions for the four High School Practice Tests and a content package including all items in those four tests.
