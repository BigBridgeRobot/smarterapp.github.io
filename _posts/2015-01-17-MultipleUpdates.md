Today Smarter Balanced has posted three new documents and updated four others on [SmarterApp.org](http://www.smarterapp.org):

* The [Assessment Package Types](http://www.smarterapp.org/deployment/AssessmentPackageTypes.html) glossary will offer some clarity as the Test Packages are released later this month.
* The [Embedded Field Test Plan](http://www.smarterapp.org/deployment/EmbeddedFieldTestPlan-2015.html) describes Smarter Balanced plans for field test items to be embedded in the Spring 2015 summative CAT tests. These items will be distributed separately from the regular Test Content Packages.
* [Interpreting Smarter Balanced Standard IDs](http://www.smarterapp.org/deployment/InterpretingSmarterBalancedStandardIDs.html) explains how to interpret Standard IDs embedded in item metadata and how to extract claim and target information.
* The [Test Results Transmission Format](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/TestResultsTransmissionFormat.html) specification has been updated with an improved XSD schema and a second sample result. Both the schema and the sample result are posted as separate files in their native formats.
* The Data Warehouse [Score Batching Specification](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/DataWarehouse-DataSpec-ScoreBatching.html) has been updated.
* The Digital Library [Technical Documentation](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/DigitalLibrary-TechnicalSystemsDocumentation.html) and [Performance Test Runbook](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/DigitalLibrary-PerformanceTestRunbook.html) have been updated.
