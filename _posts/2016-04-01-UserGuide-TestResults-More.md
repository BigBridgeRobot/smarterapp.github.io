Smarter Balanced has posted several new and updated documents in the last few days.

* The [Test Results Data Dictionary and Logical Data Model](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/TestResults-DataModel.html) now includes footnote references to the business rules for determining validity and completeness.
* The [ISAAP Accessibility Feature Codes](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/ISAAP-AccessibilityFeatureCodes.html) now include codes for [UEB Braille](http://www.brailleauthority.org/ueb.html) in anticipation of future support in the Test Delivery System.
* We have a draft summary of Smarter Balanced [Item Types and Embedded Accessibility Features](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/Item_Types_And_Features.html).
* The [Implementation Readiness Package Cross Reference](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/IRP-CrossReference.html) lists all items included in the IRP test packages including subject, type, and variation metadata; and cross-references them to where the same items appear in the [Practice and Training Tests](https://practice.smarterbalanced.org).
* The [Reporting User Guide](http://www.smarterapp.org/manuals/Reporting-UserGuide.html) has been updated to include all of the new features of the open source reporting system deployed in the last year.
