A new [Manuals and User Guides](http://www.smarterapp.org/manuals.html) section has been added to [SmarterApp.org](http://www.smarterapp.org) to make it easier to find the user guides that correspond to SmarterApp software applications. Seven user guides that were previously posted in the [Specifications](http://www.smarterapp.org/specifications.html) section have been moved into the new Manuals section.

The [Test Administrator User Guide Template](http://www.smarterapp.org/manuals/TestAdministrator-UserGuide-Template.html) was added to the Manuals section. Most of the state assessment service providers have already customized this user guide to their particular states' needs and distributed it. The template is posted as a generic reference and as a basis for future customization.
