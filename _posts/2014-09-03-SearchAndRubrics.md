title: SmarterApp Search Bar and Scoring Rubrics

Due to the accumulation of documents on SmarterApp.org we have added a search bar. It simply leverages [Google site: search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/136861) but it's an effective solution. You'll find the search bar at the top of each page.

A new memo explaining the [Smarter Balanced format for scoring rubrics](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/MachineScoringRubric.html) has been posted.
