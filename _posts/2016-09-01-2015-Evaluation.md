Smarter Balanced has released three reports evaluating the open source Test Delivery System (TDS) released by Smarter Balanced in 2015 as compared with the requirements of the RFP. Fairway Technologies produced these reports under a competitive bid contract with Smarter Balanced.

* [The Performance Evaluation Report](http://www.smarterapp.org/documents/TDS_2015_Scalability_Evaluation.pdf) indicates the capacity and performance of the software.
* [The Features Evaluation Report](http://www.smarterapp.org/documents/TDS_2015_Feature_Evaluation.pdf) evaluates the delivery of features in the released software as compared with the RFP requirements.
* [The Deployment Evaluation Report](http://www.smarterapp.org/documents/TDS_2015_Deployment_Evaluation.pdf) evaluates how easy it is to deploy and configure the software.
 
The development of the [2016 release of the TDS software](http://www.smarterapp.org/deployment/TDS_2016_Performance_Improvements.html) has been informed by these evaluations and it includes substantial improvements in all three areas.
