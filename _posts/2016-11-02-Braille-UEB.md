Smarter Balanced has posted [Technical Framework: UEB Braille Transition](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/UEB_Braille_Transition_Technical_Framework.html). This specification indicates how different braille codings will be supported during the transition from EBAE braille to UEB braille.

Concurrently, Smarter Balanced has updated the [ISAAP Accessibility Feature Codes](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/ISAAP-AccessibilityFeatureCodes.html) to make matching updates to the ISAAP braille codes.
