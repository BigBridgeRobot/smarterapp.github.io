Two important new documents have been posted on the [SmarterApp Specifications page](http://www.smarterapp.org/specifications.html) and the experimental "SmarterApp Lab" section has been added.

* A preview specification for Adaptive Algorithm describes the algorithm for selecting assessment items in the Computer Adaptive Test.
* The Training Test Item Package Cross Reference cross-references all of the items in the Smarter Balanced Training Test with the encoded versions of those items in the Preview Assessment Item Package. Notably, the training test includes examples of all assessment item types.
* In the new [SmarterApp Lab](http://www.smarterapp.org/lab.html) section we share source code for an experiment in pre-rendering assessment items to simplify assessment delivery and facilitate experimental interaction types.
