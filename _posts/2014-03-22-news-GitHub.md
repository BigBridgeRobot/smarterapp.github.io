SmarterApp will be using  [GitHub](http://github.com) as the source code repository for all applications. As a starting point, the source to SmarterApp.org website itself has been moved to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). Take a look at the [SmarterApp repository](https://github.com/SmarterApp) there. You can even help build enhancements to the site.

Also, you can now subscribe to SmarterApp news by Feed or Email.
