* [Assessment Package Types in the Smarter Balanced Distributions](http://www.smarterapp.org/deployment/AssessmentPackageTypes.html) has updated descriptions of the five assessment package types. This is posted in conjunction with the October 1st release of Smarter Balanced Summative Test Packages for 2015-2016.

* [De-Identification of Student IDs](http://www.smarterapp.org/deployment/DeidentificationOfStudentIDs.html) is a Non-Technical memo explaining to Smarter Balanced Member Agencies what to expect when their service providers use Keyed Cryptographic Hashing to produce Alterate Student IDs to preserve student privacy.

* [Student ID Cryptographic Hash Algorithm](http://www.smarterapp.org/deployment/HashStudentIdSample.html) has been augmented to include an algorithm description in addition to the existing sample code.
