The secure browsers for testing in Spring 2016 are available for [download from the Smarter Balanced FTP site](ftp://ftps.smarterbalanced.org/~sbacpublic/Public/SecureBrowsers/). These browsers correspond to the open source test delivery system. Smarter Balanced members should consult their service provider regarding the appropriate secure browser.
