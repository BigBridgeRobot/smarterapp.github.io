We are excited to announce the first source code component to be posted on SmarterApp.org. The Technology Readiness Tool (TRT) is a project commissioned in 2012 by Smarter Balanced and PARCC and developed by Pearson. Details are on the [SmarterApp Source Code Page](http://www.smarterapp.org/source.html).

In other news, the [SmarterApp Assessment Item Format preview](http://www.smarterapp.org/spec/2014/06/07/specs-AssessmentItemFormat.html) has been updated and is nearing completion.
