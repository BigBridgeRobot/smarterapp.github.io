Today we have made the following updates on [SmarterApp](http://www.smarterapp.org).

* The [Guidelines for iPad use in Testing](http://www.smarterapp.org/deployment/iPadGuidelines.html) have been updated for the 2015-2016 school year. Smarter Balanced encourages members and their service providers to coordinate messaging to the schools and districts they serve.

* [ISAAP Accessibility Feature Codes](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/ISAAP-AccessibilityFeatureCodes.html) is a new specification defining the accessibility feature codes and describing how they are transmitted between systems. This information was previously embedded in several specifications. We hope that consolidating it here will be more convenient.

* The [Test Results Data Dictionary and Logical Data Model](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/TestResults-DataModel.html) have been updated to include additional data elements and a more exact cross reference to serialization format specifications.
