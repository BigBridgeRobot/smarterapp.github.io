After two years, many developers, and countless hours of design and development we're excited to announce the first major source code release. On the [SmarterApp Source Page](http://www.smarterapp.org/source.html) we list 25 components of the test delivery system. Each includes a link to the associated code repositories. Other components will be released in the next three months. Many thanks to all who have contributed to the architecture specifications and development of this code.
