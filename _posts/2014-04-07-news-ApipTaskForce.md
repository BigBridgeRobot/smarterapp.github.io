[IMS Global](http://www.imsglobal.org) has formed a task force to develop a Smarter Balanced profile for IMS APIP. The task force met for the first time on April 3 and will meet regularly until the profile is complete. This is an important step in the Smarter Balanced commitment to make all assessment items available in the IMS APIP format.
