title: Assessment System Architecture Updated
date: 2014-08-08
---
Three new documents have been posted on [SmarterApp.org](http://www.smarterapp.org).

* The architecture team has updated the [Smarter Balanced System Architecture and Technology Report](http://www.smarterapp.org/arch/AssessmentSystemArchitecture.html). The original version was released in March of 2012 and has guided the development of the assessment delivery system. This version includes updates that reflect design decisions made during the development over the last two years. We thank Mike Powell and Measured Progress for coordinating the architecture and preparing and updating the architecture documents. (Final)

* The [Test Results Specification](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/TestResultsData.html) describes the complete set of student test results in the form that will be transmitted from test delivery systems into the data warehouse. (Draft)

* [Administration and Registration Tool - File Upload Formats](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/ART-Upload.html) describes the bulk file upload formats that will be used for provisioning user accounts and registering students. (Draft)
