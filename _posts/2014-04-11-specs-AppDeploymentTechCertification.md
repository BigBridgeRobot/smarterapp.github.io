States are responsible for deploying and operating the assessment delivery system, which is the central component in the overall Smarter Balanced assessment platform. In many cases, states will contract for system services. This brief describes the entire Smarter Balanced assessment platform, the components for which states will be responsible, and the resources that will be made available to support deployment of each state's assessment delivery system.
