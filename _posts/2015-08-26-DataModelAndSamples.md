Smarter Balanced has posted one new specification and two sets of sample data on [SmarterApp.org](http://www.smarterapp.org):

* [Test Results - Data Dictionary and Logical Data Model](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/TestResults-DataModel.html) is a new specification that describes SmarterApp test results at a logical data model layer. It's helpful for cross referencing with state data models and with data transmission formats. Includes cross references to SmarterApp data formats and Common Education Data Standards.
* The [Implementation Readiness Test Packages](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/IRP-TestPackage.html) are a set of test packages to support development and testing of test delivery systems. The packages include samples of all SmarterApp item types including machine scoring rubrics for all machine-scored items. The samples include test packages for computer-adaptive tests and fixed-form performance tasks.
* The [Sample Test Results in TRT Format](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/Sample-TRT-TestResults.html) are a set of simulated student test results in [Test Results Transmission Format](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/TestResultsTransmissionFormat.html). They are suitable for development and testing of data conversion, import, analytics, and reporting systems.
