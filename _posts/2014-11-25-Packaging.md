Three updates today! The [Assessment Item Packaging](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/SmarterApp_ItemPackaging) specification has been posted. The [Item Metadata](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/Item_Metadata_Specification.html) specification has been updated and is now in Acceptance Candidate status. And the [The Practice and Training Tests](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/PracticeAndTrainingTests.html) have been moved to an public FTP server to facilitate downloading without the use of an FTP client.
