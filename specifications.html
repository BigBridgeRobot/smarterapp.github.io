				<td>Preview</td>
				<td>A sample package of assessment items. This .zip file is organized 
				according to the draft format for test packages and contains items 
				encoded according to the SmarterApp Assessment Item Format. This 
				is a complete set of items from the Smarter Balanced Training Test 
				which may be accessed
				<a href="http://sbac.portal.airast.org/practice-test/">here</a>. 
				By comparing the encoded items with the corresponding items in the 
				Training Test you can get an example of item rendering and student 
				interaction. The package is approximately 140MB in size. A download 
				manager may be useful for slower or less reliable connections.
				<b>The file organization and data formats are subject to change. 
				The metadata file format has already been revised since this package 
				was created.</b> </td>
