In order to provide a consistent testing experience for students, ensure that test results are reliable, and protect the security of the test, the devices (computers and tablets) used by students to take the test must meet certain requirements. One requirement is that the device have installed a secure browser that prevents access to unauthorized web sites or applications.

Smarter Balanced provides open source secure browsers for six major device platforms. A particular test delivery system may also be compatible with secure browsers built into the operating system or supplied by a third party. In every case, Smarter Balanced recommends that members consult with their test delivery service provider for the list of devices and secure browsers that may be used with your testing solution.

This document lists the universal requirements for all devices followed by a list of the open source secure browsers with supported platforms and the expected sunset dates for each platform

## Universal Requirements

The following are universal requirements for all devices. Members should consult with their test delivery service provider for details on support for specific devices and operating systems.

### Sunset Dates

The general policy is to end support for a particular device or operating system after the school year in which the manufacturer withdraws support. Service providers may agree with their clients to continue supporting devices after the manufacturer withdraws support by using earlier versions of the secure browser.

## Other Compatible Secure Browsers

Smarter Balanced is actively encouraging common protocols for secure browsers that can be used with a variety of testing platforms and organizations. As we test compatibility with the open source test delivery system we will list compatible secure browsers here.
