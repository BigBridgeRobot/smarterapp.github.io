These are the [Practice and Training Test Packages](ftp://ftps.smarterbalanced.org/~sbacpublic/Public/PracticeAndTrainingTests) with all items, stimuli and metadata. They include Practice Tests for grades 3-8 and High School plus Training Tests in three grade bands.

As of the 19 December 2014 update, these packages use the same layout as the summative and interim test packages. Specifically, an outer .zip file contains everything related to the test including the test packages, content packages, and summary information.

The 19 December 2014 update also includes machine scoring rubrics for all machine-scored items. *The practice and training tests are not intended to be scored. Item scoring rubrics are supplied strictly to support development and testing of assessment delivery systems.*

Access is via anonymous FTP. These may be downloaded through a web browser but and FTP client like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) may make bulk downloads more convenient.
