The [Practice and Training Test Packages](ftp://ftps.smarterbalanced.org/~sbacpublic/Public/PracticeAndTrainingTests) with all items, stimuli and metadata have been posted on the Smarter Balanced FTP site. These include Practice Tests for grades 3-8 and High School plus Training Tests in three grade bands. Packages include test packages, item content, and item metadata. Scoring rubrics will be added shortly.

Access is via anonymous FTP. These may be downloaded through a web browser but and FTP client like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) may make bulk downloads more convenient.
