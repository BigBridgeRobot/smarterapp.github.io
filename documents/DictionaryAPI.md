Smarter Balanced has licensed the Merriam Webster dictionaries for Spring 2015 testing. API documentation is available here:

[http://dictionaryapi.com/products/index.htm](http://dictionaryapi.com/products/index.htm)

On the website you can register and obtain an API Key for development purposes. A different license key will be required for operational test administration and Smarter Balanced will supply key. The means will be announced shortly.

This document will be updated shortly to include guidelines on which dictionaries to use and how the accessibility feature should be integrated.
