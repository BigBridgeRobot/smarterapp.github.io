## Item Authoring

### [Item Authoring and Item Pool](https://github.com/SmarterApp/ItemAuthoring)
The Item Authoring and Item Pool facilitates the process of writing new assessment items, reviewing them, and adding accessibility features.

## Assessment Construction

### [Test Authoring](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/testauthoring_release)
The Test Authoring Component is responsible for test (assessment) design, construction, and publishing.

The authenticated and authorized user can define subjects, computation rules (scoring functions), item selection algorithms, and build publication relationships, all of which are then used to author tests (assessments).

Authoring of a test involves construction and configuration of segments, blueprints, test item import, forms, scoring rules, performance levels, reporting measures, and finally going through an approval workflow from users with appropriate authorization to perform approvals. The result is a test specification that can be published to Test Specification Bank (TSB) and made available further downstream for Administration and Registration Tools (ART) and Test Delivery (TDS).

### [Test Item Bank](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/testitembank_release)
The Test Item Bank component manages the importing and exporting of test (assessment) items. Major features include:
* OAuth-based security
* RESTful API
* Multi-tenant support

### [Test Specification Bank](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/testspecbank_release)
The Test Specification Bank (TSB) component is responsible for test (assessment) specification storage, searching, and initiation of packaging. The authenticated and authorized user can search for test specifications that were published from Test Authoring, view the actual specification XML, and initiate a packaging of that specification which will bundle the XML with all related Test Item data to be compressed and stored in a remote Secure FTP host location.

## Assessment Delivery

### (new) [Test Integration System](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/testintegrationsystem_release)

The Test Integration System is responsible for
* Receiving a test result from TDS (Test Delivery System)
* Sending it to THSS (Teacher HandScoring System) for hand scoring of items that require human scoring
* Receiving item scores back from THSS
* Inserting item scores into the file received from TDS
* Scoring the test
* Sending the scored test to downstream systems via SFT

### [Secure Browser](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/securebrowser7_release)
The SmarterApp Secure Browser 7. This project takes the Mozilla FireFox source code and creates a secure browser that is used to deliver student assessments. The Secure Browser implements security features such as not permitting multiple tabs, browsing arbitrary URLs and enforcing a white list of applications.

### [Test Delivery System / Proctor](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/tds_release)
Test Delivery System / Proctor includes the following functionality:
* Create /Pause or Stop Test Session
* Approve or Reject Student Test Request

### [Student Application](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/student_release)
The Student application allows users to take tests either as a guest student or using the session ID generated by a Proctor. A student may also log in using a Guest session. If using an actual session ID, a request goes to the Proctor for approval (via the Proctor app). Once the Proctor approves the request, the student can begin the test.

### [Item Renderer](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/itemrenderer_release)
The ItemRendererDev project is a group of modules that can be used for rendering assessment items during the student tests.

### [Content Uploader](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/contentuploader_release)

### [Item Scoring](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/itemscoring_release)
The ItemScoring project is a group of modules that can be used for scoring student responses for different item types.

### [TDS Maintenance](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/tdsmaintenance_release)
The Test Delivery System Maintenance component runs daily using cron job. It looks for testopportunities that are not marked completed, their status is not in ("completed", "submitted", "scored", "expired", "reported", 'invalidated') and their expire timestamp is older than the configured number of hours.

### [Administration and Registration Tools](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss/adminandregtools_release)
The Administration and Registration Tools (ART) component enables users to upload and maintain various data pertinent to the SmarterApp system including:
* Organizational hierarchy
* Students
