## [Technology Readiness Tool (TRT)](https://github.com/SmarterApp/TechnologyReadinessTool)

In 2012 the [Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium](http://www.smarterbalanced.org) and the [Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC)](http://parcconline.org/) jointly commissioned a Technology Readiness Tool to support state and local education agencies to evaluate and determine needed technology and infrastructure upgrades for the new online assessments to be launched by the two consortia in the 2014-15 school year. The tool supports surveying inventories of computing devices and associated network infrastructure and reporting on the collected data. As of June 2015 source code is available on the [SmarterApp GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SmarterApp/TechnologyReadinessTool)
