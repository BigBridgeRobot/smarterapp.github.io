Algorithm and sSample code to demonstrate how to hash a StudentID into an AlternateSSID suitable for use in de-identified student data. The code is written in C# for the Microsoft.NET platform and makes use of the associated cryptographic library.

* [Algorithm Description](/documents/HashStudentIdSample.html)
* [Sample Code](https://github.com/SmarterApp/HashStudentIdSample)
* [Non-Technical Explanation for Member States and Entities](/deployment/DeidentificationOfStudentIDs.pdf)

Vendors are not required to use this method for generating the AlternateSSID but it is a recommended practice.
