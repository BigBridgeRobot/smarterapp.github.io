The Adaptive Algorithm describes how assessment items are selected to present to students during the administration of a Computer Adaptive Test. This preview release should be considered in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.smarterbalanced.org/smarter-balanced-assessments/">Smarter Balanced Test Blueprints</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Among the details to be added before this document is finalized are rules that govern inclusion of blueprint-aligned items from up to two grade levels below or above grade level for substantially low- and high-performing students, respectively. The rules will still require the assessment to follow an on-grade blueprint, and will not increase overall test length.
