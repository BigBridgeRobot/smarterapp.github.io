A common API for diagnostics of SmarterApp web applications. The API is used to assure that installation is correct, that configuration is valid, that the system is operational, and that all communication channels are functioning properly. When a diagnostic fails, it offers details that help systems administrators quickly diagnose and correct problems. The diagnostic API is also an appropriate endpoint for monitoring and alerting systems.
