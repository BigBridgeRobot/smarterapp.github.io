This document outlines the infrastructure, technology, and data model used to develop the Digital Library as of Release 1.35 (released to production on 08/01/14). This incorporates the updates as of the end of December 2014.

Smarter Balanced will continue to host the digital library on behalf of member states so the primary purpose of this posting is for other organizations who wish to launch their own digital library.
