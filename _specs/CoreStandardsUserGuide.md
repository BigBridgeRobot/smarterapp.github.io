Core Standards serves as a repository of the standards used to design tests. Users of the Test Authoring System can retrieve and review the standards stored in Core Standards, and associate tests with those standards.

The primary use of the Core Standards component is to grant access to the core standards information by way of the Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs. This interface spec (SmarterApp Interface Specification for Core Standards Component) can be found on the smarterapp.org site.
