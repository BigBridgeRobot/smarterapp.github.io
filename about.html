<h1>About SmarterApp</h1>
<p>SmarterApp is a community of organizations devoted to collaboration on 
an open software suite for the support of educational assessment. The project 
is supported by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. The initial 
participants are organizations involved in delivery of assessments to the 
Smarter Balanced member states. However, the software suite is suitable 
for a variety of other assessment subjects and contexts. We invite all interested 
parties to participate in developing or deploying the SmarterApp solutions.

<h1>About SmarterApp.org</h1>
<p>The SmarterApp.org website is the hub of activity for the 
SmarterApp community. Presently it is the repository of specifications 
related to the SmarterApp assessment delivery platform. The collection will 
progressively grow into a complete set of specifications and, eventually, 
the full source code set. Likewise, at present, the site simply distributes 
content, but interactivity will grow to include feedback, discussion and 
eventually full collaboration on the codebase.</p>
