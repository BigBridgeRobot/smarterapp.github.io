		<p>This site is a work in progress. Accordingly, not all of the content 
		of the site has been fully vetted, or proofed. Requiring thorough review 
		would limit expedient delivery of information. Compatible with an open source 
		ethic, you can expect increasing opportunities for the community to contribute 
		refinements and improvements to the existing site and documents concurrent 
		with new information releases from Smarter Balanced. </p>
		<h1>About SmarterApp</h1>
		<p>SmarterApp is a community of organizations devoted to collaboration on 
		an open software suite for the support of educational assessment. The project 
		is supported by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. The initial 
		participants are organizations involved in delivery of assessments to the 
		Smarter Balanced member states. However, the software suite is suitable 
		for a variety of other assessment subjects and contexts. We invite all interested 
		parties to participate in developing or deploying the SmarterApp solutions.
		</p>
		<h1>About SmarterApp.org</h1>
		<p>The SmarterApp.org website will grow into the hub of activity for the 
		SmarterApp community. Presently it is the repository of a handful of specifications 
		related to the SmarterApp assessment delivery platform. The collection will 
		progressively grow into a complete set of specifications and, eventually, 
		the full source code set. Likewise, at present, the site simply distributes 
		content, but interactivity will grow to include feedback, discussion and 
		eventually full collaboration on the codebase. </p>
